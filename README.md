# Challenge Overview
I liked this challenge. Never worked on anything like this. This is my first time. Enjoyed a lot (except for tons of `500`s ;)).
Get to work with POSTMAN and pytest.
There are two file here `clean_swagger` and `generate_types`. I've written these modules to generate types from swagger file, for ease of my use. Report might not be that good, but I've tried my best. Thanks for the opportunity.
